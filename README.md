## Known issues
1. Some emotes won't show properly, this is caused by the limited colors in a sprite (I think).
2. Gifs from BetterTwitchTV are not included in this plugin.

## Data fetching
This plugin uses a service to cache the emotes from all the different platforms. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/dylanblokhuis/twitch-emotes-warehouse
